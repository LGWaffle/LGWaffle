Collective name: Lizzie
Bodily 16 - He/They mostly 

we are a system, we ask that you please be respectful when interacting with us, thanks !!

Regarding pony town and our boundries Feel free to interact whenever we dont bite!!
C+H is always on our ponies, on very rare occasion we might have the "Dniuf/Fam" tag but thats only when we dont really care for interaction at the time.

if we have a "Sys" tag next to our pony then that would indicate who is fronting in the moment so please try use the correct name/Pronouns for them (If you are unsure then PLEASE ASK!!)

We are OKAY with whispers to crown our skins or talk to us, we might not see all of them immeditely but we do try our best in that regard

uhhh not sure what else to put, will be updated over time !!
